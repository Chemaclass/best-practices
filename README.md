# PHP Best Practices

Apart from consulting:
* [PHP The Right Way](https://phptherightway.com/)
* [Clean Code adapted for PHP](https://github.com/jupeter/clean-code-php)
* [Awesome PHP libraries and resources](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php)
* [My personal Medium account](https://medium.com/@chemaclass/)

I will compile some of them that I personally consider really helpful while developing in PHP.

## Teamwork

* [Agile](/team-work/agile.md) | Agile software development values
* [Agreements](/team-work/agreements.md) | We need conventions
* [Code Reviews](/team-work/code-reviews.md) | Pair Programming & Pull Request
* [Documentation](/team-work/documentation.md) | Document your knowledge
* [Estimations](/team-work/estimations.md) | Discover the unknowns
* [Knowledge sharing](/team-work/knowledge-sharing.md) | Follow the news of your stack

## Technical skills

* [Comments](/technical-skills/comments.md) | They are not always updated 
* [Final Classes](/technical-skills/final-classes.md) | Composition over inheritance
* [Functions](/technical-skills/functions.md) | They should be small
* [Immutability](/technical-skills/immutability.md) | It makes the code more predictable and straightforward
* [Meaningful Names](/technical-skills/meaningful-names.md) | It should tell you why it exists and what it does
* [Minimum Scope](/technical-skills/minimum-scope.md) | For your variables, methods, and classes
* [Performance Tips](/technical-skills/performance-tips.md) | Use strict comparison
* [Strict Types](/technical-skills/strict-types.md) | Use strict_types constant when possible
* [Testing](/technical-skills/testing.md) | Test what your software does. Prove it!
