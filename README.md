# PHP Best Practices

Apart from consulting https://phptherightway.com/ for good practices, I will compile some of them that I personally consider really helpful while developing in PHP.

## Team work

* [Agile](/team-work/agile.md)

Agile software development values.

* [Agreements](/team-work/agreements.md)

We need conventions.

* [Documentation](/team-work/documentation.md)

Document your knowledge.

* [Estimations](/team-work/estimations.md)

Discover the unknowns.

* [Knowledge sharing](/team-work/knowledge-sharing.md)

Follow the news of your stack.

## Technical skills

* [Comments](/technical-skills/comments.md) 

The problem with comments is that they are not always updated.

* [Final Classes](/technical-skills/final-classes.md) 

A "final class" will ensure that this class is not extended by any other in the system.

* [Functions](/technical-skills/functions.md)

Functions should be small, have no side effects and a proper command/query separation.

* [Immutability](/technical-skills/immutability.md)

It makes the code more predictable and straightforward.

* [Meaningful Names](/technical-skills/meaningful-names.md)

It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.

* [Minimum Scope](/technical-skills/minimum-scope.md)

Attempt always to the minimum scope of your variables, methods, and classes.

* [Performance Tips](/technical-skills/performance-tips.md)

Use strict comparison as much as possible.

* [Strict Types](/technical-skills/strict-types.md)

Use strict_types constant when possible; specially for your new files.

* [Testing](/technical-skills/testing.md)

Prove the expected behaviour of your software.
