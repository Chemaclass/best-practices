# PHP Best Practices

Apart from consulting https://phptherightway.com/ for good practices, I will compile some of them that I personally consider really helpful while developing in PHP.

* [Agreements](/agreements.md)

> We need conventions. 

* [Comments](/comments.md)

> The problem with comments is that they are not always updated.

* [Final Classes](/final-classes.md)

>  When you see a class prefix with the `final` you will be sure that this class is not extended by any other in the code.

* [Functions](/functions.md)

> Functions should be small, have no side effects and a proper command/query separation.

* [Immutability](/immutability.md)

> It makes the code more predictable and straightforward. So we can be sure that our data are truths.

* [Meaningful Names](/meaningful-names.md)

> It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.

* [Minimum Scope](/minimum-scope.md)

> Use `private` by default.

* [Performance Tips](/performance-tips.md)

> Use strict comparison as much as possible.

* [Strict Types](/strict-types.md)

> Use strict_types constant when possible; specially for your new PHP files.
