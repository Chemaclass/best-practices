## Teamwork

* [Agile](/team-work/agile.md) <- Agile software development values
* [Agreements](/team-work/agreements.md) <- We need conventions
* [Code Reviews](/team-work/code-reviews.md) <- Pair Programming & Pull Request
* [Documentation](/team-work/documentation.md) <- Document your knowledge
* [Estimations](/team-work/estimations.md) <- Discover the unknowns
* [Knowledge sharing](/team-work/knowledge-sharing.md) <- Follow the news of your stack

## Technical skills

* [Comments](/technical-skills/comments.md) <- They are not always updated 
* [Final Classes](/technical-skills/final-classes.md) <- Composition over inheritance
* [Functions](/technical-skills/functions.md) <- They should be small
* [Immutability](/technical-skills/immutability.md) <- It makes the code more predictable and straightforward
* [Meaningful Names](/technical-skills/meaningful-names.md) <- It should tell you why it exists and what it does
* [Minimum Scope](/technical-skills/minimum-scope.md) <- For your variables, methods, and classes
* [Performance Tips](/technical-skills/performance-tips.md) <- Use strict comparison
* [Strict Types](/technical-skills/strict-types.md) <- Use strict_types constant when possible
* [Static Analysis](/technical-skills/static-analysis.md) <- Identify bugs in your code
* [Testing](/technical-skills/testing.md) <- Test what your software does
