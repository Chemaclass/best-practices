# Estimations and Story points

## Basics

Good estimations help us to achieve the best possible efficiency within our team and greatly help our Product Managers in the sprint planning process.

Estimations can be done in different ways. You can estimate time or complexity. 

In my personal experience, I would prefer to estimate complexity, because it helps to pop up the unknowns and uncertainties that each individual of the team has.

Use fibonacci numbers. This makes it easier to distinguish between complexity levels and to reach a relative estimate rather than a specific "complexity score".
