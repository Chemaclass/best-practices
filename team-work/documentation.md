# Documentation

## Document your knowledge

1. Use files (for example as this repository does with the MD files) to document the things that need to be documented
or would be useful to have record somewhere.

2. Avoid writing documentation as comments in the code if you can make the code express itself!
More about this topic [here](../technical-skills/comments.md).
