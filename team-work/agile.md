## Minimize the scope of your tasks

Try to minimize the scope of your working tickets to the minimum value that could make sense, 
in term of deployability or just moving forward the ticket itself for the next status; 
to Review or QA, for example.

Keeping in mind a small and concrete goal to achieve by the given ticket description helps you to focus on the **Acceptance Criteria** that the tickets ask you to complete. 

There is an excellent kata/exercise to train exactly this, it's called "[Elephant Carpaccio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TCuuu-8Mm14oxsOnlk8DqfZAA1cvtYu9WGv67Yj_sSk/pub)".

## Agile software development values

* Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
* Working Software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to Change over following a plan

## Agile software development principles

1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
