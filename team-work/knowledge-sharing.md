# Knowledge sharing

### Follow the news of your stack

Nowadays every stack have its social media account, and you should be aware of that for some reasons:

* New version releases with dates and change logs.
* Development status of that tool.
* Easy communication with the people behind.

### Tech talks

For bigger development-teams, it makes sense to share their knowledge time-boxing some time for them in order 
to talk and discuss any recently tech-related discovering or learned topic.

### Writing blog-posts

It helps to the team members to consolidate and share with the external world some interesting tech-topics, as well within their team.

An option for this it might be having your own [Medium account](https://medium.com/@chemaclass).
