# Agreements

## We need conventions

Why?

* Working with different people mean to have different opinions.
* Different opinions usually end into disagreements.
* Disagreements can potentially end in discussions.
* Recursive discussions generate burns down.
* We should aim to avoid burns downs.

## The best way

The concept of “the best way” or “the right way” depends on who are affected people, and how do they want to use it.

In the context of software development, agreements should be, indeed, a *must*. Especially having so different 
backgrounds, cultures, the way of thinking, experience, readings, and understanding of life.
