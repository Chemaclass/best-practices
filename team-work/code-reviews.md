# Code Reviews

## Benefits

* It helps to share the changes (and therefore knowledge) with the rest of your colleagues.
* It helps to double-check if the changes are the correct ones or you might have forgotten something important while doing your changes.

## Common approaches

* Pair Programming
* By creating a Pull Request

### Pair Programming

Pairing is the act of two people working together on a single programming problem.

Pairing programmers sometimes adopt different roles. One may be the driver and the other the navigator.

Most often, however, there are no roles at all. The programmers are simply co-equal authors sharing the mouse and keyboard in a cooperative manner.

Pairs are not scheduled. They are generally short-lived. They are often not more than an hour or two.

Pair Programing shouldn't be just for Seniors to mentor Juniors. 

It shouldn't be mandatory but highly recommended due it's benefits:

* The members of a team do not work in isolation from each other.
* Is the best way, by far, to share knowledge between team members and prevent knowledge silos from forming.
* It's the best way to make sure that nobody on the team is indispensable.

While you practice Pair Programming the code it's being reviewed all the time. Two brains think better than one.
Thus, the review is not simply a static check to ensure that the team's coding standards are applied. 
Rather, it's a dynamic review of the current state of the code with an eye to where the code needs to be in the near future.
