# Git Mastering

> Using git via the terminal or via your IDE?

## Command Tool

It's true that you can use git with your IDE ([PhpStorm](./ide.md), for example) but you should know 
the fundamentals behind these "shor-cuts" buttons.

Double check that you know exactly how the git commands work behind the scene using terminal
before you get use to these button-helpers.

```
git status
git checkout
git diff
git rebase
git pull
git push
git stash
git cherry-pick
...
```

You can even create your own aliases or use the ones that [omyzh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Cheatsheet#git) provide for you.
