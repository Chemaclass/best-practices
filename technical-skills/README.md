# PHP Best Practices

## Technical skills

* [Comments](comments.md) 

The problem with comments is that they are not always updated.

* [Final Classes](final-classes.md) 

A "final class" will ensure that this class is not extended by any other in the system.

* [Functions](functions.md)

Functions should be small, have no side effects and a proper command/query separation.

* [Immutability](immutability.md)

It makes the code more predictable and straightforward.

* [Meaningful Names](meaningful-names.md)

It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.

* [Minimum Scope](minimum-scope.md)

Attempt always to the minimum scope of your variables, methods, and classes.

* [Performance Tips](/technical-skills/performance-tips.md)

Use strict comparison as much as possible.

* [Strict Types](/technical-skills/strict-types.md)

Use strict_types constant when possible; specially for your new files.

* [Testing](/technical-skills/testing.md)

Prove the expected behaviour of your software.
