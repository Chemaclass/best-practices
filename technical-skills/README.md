# PHP Best Practices

## Technical skills

The problem with comments is that they are not always updated:

* [Comments](/technical-skills/comments.md) 

A "final class" will ensure that this class is not extended by any other in the system:

* [Final Classes](/technical-skills/final-classes.md) 

Functions should be small, have no side effects and a proper command/query separation:

* [Functions](/technical-skills/functions.md)

It makes the code more predictable and straightforward:

* [Immutability](/technical-skills/immutability.md)

It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used:

* [Meaningful Names](/technical-skills/meaningful-names.md)

Attempt always to the minimum scope of your variables, methods, and classes:

* [Minimum Scope](/technical-skills/minimum-scope.md)

Use strict comparison as much as possible:

* [Performance Tips](/technical-skills/performance-tips.md)

Use strict_types constant when possible; specially for your new files:

* [Strict Types](/technical-skills/strict-types.md)

Prove the expected behaviour of your software:

* [Testing](/technical-skills/testing.md)
