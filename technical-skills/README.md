# PHP Best Practices

## Technical skills

* [Comments](comments.md) <- They are not always updated 
* [Final Classes](final-classes.md) <- Composition over inheritance
* [Functions](functions.md) <- They should be small
* [Immutability](immutability.md) <- It makes the code more predictable and straightforward
* [Meaningful Names](meaningful-names.md) <- It should tell you why it exists and what it does
* [Minimum Scope](minimum-scope.md) <- For your variables, methods, and classes
* [Performance Tips](performance-tips.md) <- Use strict comparison
* [Strict Types](strict-types.md) <- Use strict_types constant when possible
* [Testing](testing.md) <- Test what your software does. Prove it!
